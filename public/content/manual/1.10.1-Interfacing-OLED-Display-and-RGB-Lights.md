### 1.10.1 Interfacing OLED Display and RGB Lights

In this section, we demonstrate how to use Mind+ visual blocks to control the **OLED display** and **RGB lights** on the sheenbot∞ board.

Before proceeding, ensure the sheenbot∞ extension is properly loaded into Mind+ as explained in **Section 1.9.1**. Follow these setup steps to start writing your first sheenbot programme:

1. Change the mode from **"Online" to "Offline"** if it is not on offline mode by default.
2. Start a new project by clicking the **Project** tab
3. Click the **Extensions** tab.
4. Select the board **FireBeetle ESP32-E**.
5. Open the **User-Ext** tab and select the **sheenbot∞ extension**, as shown in **Figure 1.10a**.

6. Click **Back** to return to the Woekspace area.

The Mind+ interface consists of three main sections: the **Block Palette** on the left (where you drag coding blocks from), the **Coding Area** in the middle (where you build your program visually), and the **Code Tabs** on the right (which show the auto-generated code and allow manual editing). These sections are illustrated in **Figure 1.10.1b**.


Once set up, you're ready to create a sample program that writes text to the OLED screen and changes the RGB light color based on logic blocks.

Now, once you are in the workspace (see **Figure 1.10.1c** for all the following isntructions):

- Click on the **User** icon expansion on the far left inside the **Block Palette**.
- Drag the following blocks into the **forever** loop inside your **Coding Area**:
  - `lampNumber[]displayColor[]`
  `
- You can set the `lampNumber` for the specific RGB light you want to turn on.
- You can also select the colour for each RGB light.

- Paste the line **3 times** and select a specific lamp number and colour for each RGB light as shown in **Figure 1.10c**.

- Drag the **screen display text** block into your **forever** loop and customize it to print the text of your choice.
- Connect to your sheenbot by clicking the Connect Device tab, as shown in step 3 of **Figure 1.10.1c**.
- Upload your code using the Upload button indicated in step 4 of the same figure. 
- The **Console Window** will display messages showing the progress of the code upload and confirm when it has been successfully uploaded.
- After a successful upload, your OLED display will show the custom text, and the RGB lights will turn on as programmed.
