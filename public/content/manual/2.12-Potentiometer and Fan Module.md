A potentiometer is an analog input device that changes its resistance based on how much the knob is turned. This change is measured as an analog value between 0 and 4095. It is commonly used to control other components such as LEDs or motors in a gradual, user-controlled way.

A fan module is an output device that uses a small DC motor to generate airflow. It can be turned on, off, or have its speed adjusted using a digital or PWM signal, making it useful in interactive electronics and smart cooling systems.

**Example Applications:**
- Adjusting LED brightness
- Controlling motor or fan speed
- Building user-controlled interfaces

### 2.12.1 Example Code for the Light Sensor

The light sensor outputs an analog value (typically between 0 and 4095) based on the surrounding light. In this example, we check if the brightness exceeds a threshold (4080) to turn on a yellow lamp.

    <ul>
      <li><b>Hardware Setup:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Connect a potentiometer to analog pin <code>P0</code>.</li>
          <li>Attacha Piranha LED to <code>P15</code>, and a fan module to <code>P16</code>.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Programming Steps (Block-Based):</b>
        <ul>
          <li><b>LED Brightness:</b> Set the LED intensity on <code>P15</code> using the potentiometer value (<code>set LED on P15 output read POTENTIOMETER on P0</code>).</li>
          <li><b>Fan Speed:</b> Adjust the fan speed on <code>P16</code> proportionally to the potentiometer reading (<code>set Fan on P16 output read POTENTIOMETER on P0</code>).</li>
          <li><b>Display Value:</b> Map the raw potentiometer range <code>[0, 4095]</code> to <code>[0, 100]</code> and show it on-screen (<code>screen display text map...</code>).</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><b>Key Notes:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>The potentiometer’s 12-bit analog input (0–4095) is scaled to 0–100% for readability.</li>
          <li>All outputs (servo, LED, fan) react simultaneously to the potentiometer’s position.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
