### 1.10.3 Using the Gyroscope to Trigger Speaker and RGB Output

In this example, the sheenbot∞ uses its built-in gyroscope sensor to detect specific movements or orientations. When a defined motion condition is met—such as tilting or shaking—the program activates an RGB LED to glow red, providing a visual alert. Simultaneously, the speaker is triggered to audibly respond by speaking a custom message and playing a ringtone. This integration of motion sensing and audio-visual feedback demonstrates how users can build interactive and responsive projects using sheenbot∞’s onboard sensors and outputs.
 
Here’s how the sheenbot∞ uses its gyroscope to trigger the speaker and RGB lights:
<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; justify-content: space-between;">
  <div style="flex: 1;">
    <ul>
      <li>Continuously monitor the gyroscope orientation</li>
      <li>Check if tilt or movement meets the defined condition (e.g., specific angle or shake)</li>
      <li>If condition is met:
        <ul>
          <li>Turn on RGB LED 2 (red) to indicate trigger</li>
          <li>Use speaker to say a custom message (e.g., "Motion detected!")</li>
          <li>Play a ringtone (e.g., "ring_1") using the speaker</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
